  "softcoding": "y'all need to stop with this softcoding stuff:\n\nYou're generally referring to removing repeated code – and yes, this a good thing, normally. However, there are two issues with the attitude around this.\n\nFirst, not every situation mandates this kind of code structure. This is especially true of smaller games made by newer developers. We shouldn't avoid adding certain QOL features simply because in a \"properly\" coded game it isn't necessary. This second point doesn't apply specifically to this conversation but I see it coming up frequently so here goes: a lot of people take this way too far.\n\nI have seen so many plots where they do crazy things like spawn items on the ground to load information and whatnot. This is not good. Don't sacrifice code legibility and efficiency simply because they believe it makes coding experience easier. There is a delicate balance between well designed, easy to maintain, and efficient code. Softcoding is not always the way to achieve this balance. So please, just think about the systems you're designing and whether or not anything is actually improved.\n\ntl;dr  elitism through \"better practice\" / softcoding doesn't help, and often it isn't the right answer",
  "gamer": "No you’re NOT a gamer\nNo you’re NOT a gamer\nI’m so sick of all these people who think they’re gamers. No, you’re not. Most of you are not even close to being gamers. I see these people saying “I put well over 100hrs in this game and it’s great!” That’s nothing, most of us can easily put 300+ in all of our games, I see people who only have the Nintendo switch and claim to be gamers. Come talk to me when you pick up a PS4 controller then we’ll be friends.\nAlso DEAR WOMEN: Pokémon is not a real game. Animal Crossing is not a real game. The sims is not a real game. Mario is not a real game. Stardew Valley is not a real game. Mobile games are NOT. REAL. GAMES. Put down the baby games and play something that requires challenge and skill for once.\n-sincerely, all of the ACTUAL gamers",

  "british": "Do british people actually exist? I mean, they must be a meme, there is a not a single thing about them. And I mean it. Let's go through the evidence: Where are they from? Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea. There is a consensus on british people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these british people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy. What language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed \"\"british\"\" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh? And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker. So I looked up \"british dictionary on google\" and what I found was shocking: every word in there was AMERICAN. I kid you not. What this could mean is beyond my capabilities, but I can safely assure you that british people do not exist.",
